# development stack

I use a combination of **Supabase** For the backend, And
**Next.js** or **SvelteKit** or **Astro** & **Storyblok** For the frontend.

of corse i use more than those tools to ship my web applications, Those include
but no limitied to **Tailwindcss** to ship my design faster and **Netlify** to ship
my **Next.js** faster, And **GitHub** to store my source code, And **Git** to work
with this same source code, And **Framer Motion** to have animation on my web apps,
And **Lucide** to add all kind of icons to my websites.


# learnning
