# zomowareceo

Hello, My name is **Ilyas Husain**, I'm the **ceo** and **co-founder** of zomoware,
I have been a **web developer** since 2020, initialy started with just **HTML**
and **CSS**, And now I'm on the way to learn JavaScript(with Next.js).


# Development Stack

I use a combination of **PlanetScale** & **Prisma** & **Passage** For the backend, And
**Next.js** & **Sanity.io** For the frontend.

of corse i use more than those tools to ship my web applications, Those include
but no limitied to **Tailwindcss** to ship my design faster and **Vercel** to ship
my **Next.js** faster, And **GitHub** to store my source code, And **Git** to work
with this same source code, And **Framer Motion** to have animation on my web apps.

I'll be happy to contact you on my twitter account when ever I have the time, Bye.
