# zomowareceo

Hello, My name is **Ilyas Husain**, I'm the **Co-founder and CEO of zomoware.**,
I have been a **web developer** since 2020, initialy started with just **HTML**
and **CSS**, And now I'm on the way to learn JavaScript(**with Next.js / SvelteKit**).


# Development Stack

I use a combination of **Supabase** For the backend, And
**Next.js** or **SvelteKit** & **Netlify CMS** For the frontend.

of corse i use more than those tools to ship my web applications, Those include
but no limitied to **Tailwindcss** to ship my design faster and **Netlify** to ship
my **Next.js** faster, And **GitHub** to store my source code, And **Git** to work
with this same source code, And **Framer Motion** to have animation on my web apps,
And **Lucide** to add all kind of icons to my websites.


# Learnning

as my journey continues i want to learn a lot of interesting new technologies like
**PlanetScale** & **PolyScale** & **Flutter** and a lot more technologies that i'm interested in.
